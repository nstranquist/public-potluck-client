### Public Potluck Client

### Mission
The objective of public potluck is to create a crowdsourcing platform that encourages communities to take initiative and enable each other make the right food available and accessible.  We were inspired by a single mother in St. Louis who volunteered her time and money every morning to make breakfast and lunch for hungry schoolchildren in her neighborhood. We hope that our platform will allow others to either do the same or help continue what incredible people like her have started.
